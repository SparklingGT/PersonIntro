Day 1 (12/09/16) :

1) Basic Layout

2) Basic Structure

Day 2 (13/09/16) :

1) Add 3 different listener to Edittext.
   Focus -> Copy to clipboard
   Longclick -> Edit / Open picker dialog (the latter one is not done yet)
   Click -> TBD

2) Edittext would not gain focus when window (the card) first got opened.

3) When finishing editing Edittext you can touch anywhere on screen to exit editing, 
   and Edittext would lose focus accordingly.

4) Tap the "BACK" button on device while editing Edittext would cause it to lose focus.


Day 3 (14/09/16) :

1) Add a gender dialog to pick the gender that they identify themselves as 
   (not what you think what gender they are). This dialog has been themed.

2) Add a datePicker dialog to select one's birthday, you can only select days from
   01/01/1900 to 31/12/2025, and fix weird glitches on my Note 5 by setting scaleX attribute
   (not a good solution I think).

3) Add a timePicker dialog to select time, I feel like it is actually a bit unneccesary, but figure this
   might actually make a good practice anyway.

4) SQLite databases comes to play.


Day 4 (15/09/16) :

1) Add save system.

2) Adding cards is now possible.

3) Deleting cards is now possible.

4) Taking picture and save it is now possible.

7) Long tap on the photo will bring up your image viewr app w/ the pic on it

8) Toolbar added.

9) Change the behavior of datepicker.
