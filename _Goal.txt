Homework: Person Card

After seeing TheBigNerdRanch 2e (android) finishes its 2nd app, 
I feel the needs to put all the things that I learned into practice. 

I myself set up this project (aka homework) for myself to practice,
the project has to contain name, gender, birthday (down to minutes),
intro of that person, the pic of that person.
